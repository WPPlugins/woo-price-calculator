WooPrice Calculator, the extension to give a price of product according to its characteristics with mathematical formulas.
== Description ==

Welcome to WooPrice Calculator, the first WooCommerce extension that lets website owners create variable prices for their products, based on the features chosen by their customers. There’s no need for any programming knowledge.
The features of the products become variables in mathematical formulas that were created and matched to those products. Customers will be able to modify those variables through the product's characteristics on a product page, directly modifying the final value of the product and their shopping cart.
